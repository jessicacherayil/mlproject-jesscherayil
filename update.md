My goal for this milestone was to have a graph of all the characters and their interactions, and to have completed my vectors for each character. I am about 75% of the way to finishing this goal. I think the process of capturing all interactions is a bit more involved than I thought, so I have some of the features completed, but not all of them. Before completion, I need to finish creating the vectors for each character. I will then build a hopefully interactive graph for my research, and be able to push these vectors through the linear regression model we already created. I also know I am still missing several mentions of characters since they are mentioned by pronouns, but I am having a lot of trouble finding packages online that do pronoun resolution in French; I think I might build my own, simplified version.
