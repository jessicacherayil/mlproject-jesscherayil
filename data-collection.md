My data consists of 1) a matrix, in which each row represents a character and each column represents a feature that is some measure of interaction, and 2) The y array (found at the bottom of mentions.py) contains the true labels, which are the genders for each character (1 for female, 0 for male). The matrix will be self-created by parsing the text (novel.txt, included in the repo), so most of my work will be calculating feature values. I have not yet finished creating all features for all characters, but once I do, running the data through the linear regression model should be fairly simple.  

You can find all my featurization work in mentions.py. I have already written methods to retrieve the average number of mentions per page for each character, and the average distance between two characters.
I've also started work on capturing interactions between characters, so that I can extract more features, such as the percentage of verbal vs. non-verbal interactions, or the number of interactions had with the princess.  

I am planning on splitting the data of 30 characters into 20 training, 5 development, 5 testing.
